## Issues Encountered
We did not encounter any major issues. One small issue was how to implement
the constructors. It wasn't immediately clear how much of each constructor should
be inherited and wether the constructor should include variables for type or noise.
Eventually, we decided that constructors at the animal-level should call super()
and that type and noise should be fixed at that level.

## Instructions to run
